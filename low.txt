The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.
Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls.
When you are doing something that is right, you just do it.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.
In order to write about life first you must live it.
The big lesson in life, baby, is never be scared of anyone or anything.
All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret.
I intend to live life, not just exist.
A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.
